🎓 IBM SkillBuild AI/ML Internship Project

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillBuild AI/ML Internship**.  
It uses the UCI Adult Census Dataset to predict whether a person earns more than \$50K per year based on their demographic attributes using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a binary classification model to determine if an individual earns more than \$50K annually.  
The prediction is based on demographic and employment-related features such as:

- Age
- Education level
- Hours worked per week
- Marital status
- Occupation
- Capital gain/loss

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python (Google Colab)
- 🧮 Pandas, NumPy
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (KNN model)
- 📊 Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. Upload dataset (`adult 3.csv`)
2. Handle missing data
3. Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder
4. Train-test split (80/20)
5. Train K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model
6. Evaluate accuracy and classification metrics
7. Visualize:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy vs K Value plot

---

## ✅ Results

- 📈 **Model Accuracy:** ~83%
- 📊 Visual evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report
- 🔁 Accuracy tuned by trying different K values (1–20)

## 📈 Future Scope

- 🔗 Deploy model as a Streamlit web app
- 📏 Improve accuracy by applying feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- ⚖️ Try different ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- 🔍 Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
